# SuperNova - V1.1
Overview
SuperNova is a powerful web application designed for educational purposes, allowing users to control bots, create their own botnets, and simulate Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. The primary goal of SuperNova is to provide users with a hands-on understanding of network security, the implications of botnets, and the methodologies behind DDoS attacks.

 # Disclaimer: This application is intended for educational purposes only. Misuse of this software can result in severe legal consequences. Users are strongly advised to use SuperNova responsibly and only in controlled environments.

# Features
Bot Control: Seamlessly manage your bots through an intuitive interface.
Botnet Creation: Set up and configure a botnet tailored to your needs.
DDoS Simulation: Launch controlled DDoS simulations to understand the impact of such attacks on target servers.
Real-Time Monitoring: Monitor the status and performance of your bots and the results of your simulations.
Interactive Dashboard: Use a user-friendly dashboard to navigate through various functionalities, including managing ngrok URLs, sending commands, and displaying output.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

Python 3.x
Flask
Ngrok (for tunneling)
Required libraries listed in requirements.txt
Installation
Clone the repository:


git clone https://github.com/Arctichonour/SuperNova
cd supernova
Install the required packages:


pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Flask application:


python app.py
Start ngrok:

ngrok http 5000
Access the application at http://localhost:5000 or through the provided ngrok URL.

# Usage
Setting Up Bots: Navigate to the bots management page to configure and manage your bots.
Launching Simulations: Use the dashboard to send commands and initiate DDoS simulations against a controlled environment.
Monitoring: View real-time status updates and results of your simulations.
Risks and Ethical Considerations
While SuperNova provides a platform for educational exploration, users must be aware of the following risks:

 # Legal Consequences: Unauthorized use of DDoS attacks is illegal and can lead to prosecution.
# Ethical Responsibility: Users must ensure that they conduct all activities ethically, only targeting systems for which they have explicit permission.
# Impact on Systems: Even in a controlled environment, simulating DDoS attacks can impact system performance and availability. Ensure you have the necessary resources and permissions before proceeding.
